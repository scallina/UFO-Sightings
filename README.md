# UFO-Sightings

## Overview
In this project, I used javascript to build a webpage with a dynamic table to allow users to filter between different UFO data sightings by multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
This page can be used to filter from an existing dataset by sighting date, city, state, country, and shape. For example, a user searching for all sphere-shaped sightings in the state of california would yield the results below:
![CA-sphere sightings filtered](https://github.com/scallina/UFO-Sightings/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-02-01%20at%2010.39.43%20PM.png)

## Summary
One drawbac of the design is that it assumes the user understands the various shapes and patterns of UFO sightings. In future versions, I would add a key that shows an example photo of each sighting shape. I would also include a filter for users to differentiate between daytime and nighttime sightings.
